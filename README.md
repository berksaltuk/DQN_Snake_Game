# DQN_Snake_Game
Pygame &amp; Pytorch implementation for AI Agent that plays snake game using Deep Q Learning.
Run agent.py to see the agent play and get trained. 
I made this implementation while learning DQNs and watching Patrick Loeber's tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8ypSXwyBds&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org).
